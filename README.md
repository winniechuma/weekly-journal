[PA Write Up](https://markefontenot.notion.site/PA-05-8263d28a81a7473d8372c6579abd6481)
- [ ]  A pitch for your program describing each of its features (pretend youâ€™re writing an App Store description);

- Check it, our journal, is an easy application to navigate. By going on each day of the week, you are able to create a task or an event
- or both for that specific day. For each task, you get to name it, give it a description, and decide whether it is complete or not. For the 
- events, you are also able to name the event, describe it, set its duration, and the time. Too much fun things, you need to check it out to 
- see. Your events and tasks can also be viewed in the mini viewer, where you see the entire week. There is a side-bar, where you get to see 
- all the tasks you have in that week in one place. If you also want to discipline yourself and make sure that you do all the tasks or events,
- you can set a limit for the tasks or events, so that you have an efficient number of things to accomplish. Let's not forget about the quotes.
- We love ourselves a motivation quote through out the week. Clicking the 'create a Quote' button allows you to set a quote in the quote section 
- for the week. On the upper corner, you can also select from three different themes, excluding the original background'. Aside from all the 
- cool features, there's a cooler one even. When the 'click me' button is clicked, there is more features such as naming your week, see the weekly
- overview (shows the total tasks, total events, and the percentage of tasks completed), a button that allows you to pick colors for the week view
- (Background, the color of the button days, boarder color, title text color)

- [ ]  At least one screenshot showcasing your GUI and its features;

- [ ]  A descriptive example of how you applied each SOLID principle to your project (1 short paragraph per principle);
- S We implemented this principle by Making different pop up classes for different Gui FXML popup features. In our 
- journal controller implementation our controllers main purpose is to make popups.
- O We implemented this by not namking any classes private 
- L We implemented this by not having any super classes and subclasses so we dont have to worry about the behavior being
- affected
- I We implemented this by not having any interfaces that forced a client to implement what isn't needed 
- D


- [ ]  A detailed description of how you could extend your program to add an additional, non-implemented Feature from above; and
- We could extend our program to add more feature by allowing the user to  set a password when they first enter the program.
- We could also allow the user to drag the tasks and events in whatever order they want to do 
- We could allow the user to choose a vertical or horizontal display 
- We could create a jar file so we could deploy the application by double clicking 
- We could allow the user to also chane the fonts not only the color 
- 
- [ ]  Attribution for any images utilized in your program.
- We have a book image 
- We have the check it png image 
- We have a drinks image icon
- We have a emoji celebration image
- We have a pray image
- We have a sun image
- We have a thunderstorm image
